I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s time to get more active online, I&#8217;ve always been lurking in forums and posting on Reddit, but I want to give back more.

For me, blogs are one of the biggest sources of information when looking at new technology. Whether it&#8217;s an honest review of a product or a deployment guide that highlights all the &#8216;gotchas&#8217; that would otherwise catch out first timers.

So I&#8217;m going to give it my best shot to write at least one useful post a week, sharing gotchas and other learnings that might help someone else out.

Next week will probably be an exception though as I&#8217;ll be attending the Microsoft Ignite event in Atlanta, as I was lucky enough to be invited to speak this year!

So if you&#8217;re at Ignite, check out the Storage Spaces Direct talks and you might see me hanging round.
